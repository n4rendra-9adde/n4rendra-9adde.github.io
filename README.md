## 🚀 Projects

### 🔹 1. Azure Secure Cloud Architecture
Designed and deployed a **secure Azure cloud environment** with multi-VNet topology, NSGs, custom routes, and Azure Firewall (DNAT + Application Rules).  
Ensured compliance, segmentation, and controlled VM access via Jump Host and Application Gateway (WAF).

### 🔹 2. Hybrid Identity with Azure AD Connect (PTA)
Implemented **Pass-Through Authentication with Cloud Sync** and **Conditional Access policies** for secure hybrid identity federation.  
Enhanced authentication redundancy and enforced MFA-based access control.

### 🔹 3. Ethical Hacking & Pentesting Labs
Performed end-to-end penetration testing including:
- Scanning with Nmap & analyzing packets via Wireshark  
- Exploiting vulnerable VMs using Metasploit  
- Performing privilege escalation and lateral movement in lab networks  

### 🔹 4. Network Automation at Ericsson
Developed automation scripts and RPA bots (Python + UiPath) for ITSM and incident response pipelines, ensuring SLA compliance and reducing manual workload by 40%.
